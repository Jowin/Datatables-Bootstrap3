# Fork info

This fork has the following changes:

  * Bidirectional CSS file to support both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts
  * Control over pagination icon classes (for RTL support) via the following  `oLanguage` parameters:
    * `sIconClassFirst` (default: `glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-backward`)
    * `sIconClassLast` (default: `glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-forward`)
    * `sIconClassPrevious` (default: `glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left`)
    * `sIconClassNext` (default: `glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right`)
  * Notes in the CSS on how to use Font Awesome for the sorting icons (hopefully better support is coming to upstream in 1.10 - see [this](https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables/issues/165))

Note to self: Revisit all of this once 1.10 is released and see what can be thrown away.

Datatables-Bootstrap3
=====================

Quick Start
-------------------------------
Copy these files and the images inside assets to your project and include them in the page.

1. assets/css/datatables.css
2. assets/js/datatables.js
3. assets/images/*  

Please note : If you copy the images to a folder other than images in your project, be sure to update the image path in the datatables.css file.

Pagination types
-------------------------------

1. Normal:

		//Default Type
        $('.datatable').dataTable(); 
		$('.datatable').dataTable({"sPaginationType": "bs_normal"});	

2. Two Buttons:

        $('.datatable').dataTable({"sPaginationType": "bs_two_button"});
		
2. Four Buttons:

        $('.datatable').dataTable({"sPaginationType": "bs_four_button"});
		
2. Full :

        $('.datatable').dataTable({"sPaginationType": "bs_full"});

5. Full Pages :

        $('.datatable').dataTable({"sPaginationType": "bs_full_pages"});

Note: These are extended pagination types without modifying the existing pagination types.
